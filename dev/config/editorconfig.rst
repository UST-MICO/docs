EditorConfig
======================

We use EditorConfig to maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.
EditorConfig files are human readable and most IDEs support it without additional plugins, e.g. IntelliJIDEA.
Nevertheless Eclipse and VisualStudio Code need additional plugins.

If you are using Eclipse, you can install the editorconfig-eclipse plugin.
For VisualStudio Code you can install the EditorConfig for VS Code plugin.

The EditorConfig file is pushed in main directory of the mico repository.
