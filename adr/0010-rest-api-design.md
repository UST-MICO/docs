# REST API Design

## Context and Problem Statement

RESTful APIs can be designed differently, e.g., there are discussions about how to name resources correctly or what kind of HTTP methods should be used to trigger actions.

## Decision Outcome

We follow the guidelines proposed by the [Learn REST: A RESTful Tutorial](https://www.restapitutorial.com).
