# Browser Compatibility

## Context and Problem Statement

Which browser should we actively support with the MICO web interface?

## Considered Options

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Edge
* Internet Explorer

## Decision Outcome

We will only actively support Chrome (above version 70). We may test the web interface occasionally with Firefox (above version 63) to fix issues rendering the web interface unusable with firefox.
