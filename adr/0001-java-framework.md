# Java Framework

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to use a well established Java framework in order to bootstrap and boost our development process.

## Considered Options

* <https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot>
* <http://micronaut.io/index.html>
* <https://www.playframework.com>
* <https://akka.io>
* <https://www.dropwizard.io/1.3.5/docs>
* <https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-microprofile> with <https://openliberty.io>

## Decision Outcome

We chose option 1, Spring Boot, since existing knowledge and experience with this framework is available.
To reduce training costs (time) we chose this option.
