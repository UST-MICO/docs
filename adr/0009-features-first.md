# Features first

## Context and Problem Statement

How should we prioritise certain non-/extra- functional requirements?

## Considered Options

**Requirements:**

* Translatable text in user Interface
* Minimal security (username+password login for user interface/tokens for api)
* Responsive Web design


## Decision Outcome

For the initial project we won't implement the requirements from above to increase our efficiency in implementing features.
