# Features first

## Context and Problem Statement

How should we prioritise certain non-/extra- functional requirements?

## Considered Options

Requirements:

 *  Translatable text in user Interface
 *  Minimal security (username+password login for user interface/tokens for api)
 *  Responsive Web design


## Decision Outcome

For the initial project we won't implement the requirements from above to increase our efficiency in implementing features.
