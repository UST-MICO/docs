## Context and Problem Statement
A Simple Composition Component is a [Generic Component](https://github.com/UST-MICO/mico/issues/724), that follows the concept of a certain [Enterprise Integration Pattern](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com) by invoking a user-defined (or predefined) openFaaS function and acting upon its results. In contrast to the [Complex Integration Components](https://github.com/UST-MICO/docs/blob/master/adr/0025-implementation-of-complex-eai-patterns-with-faas.md) there are no further efforts (such as maintaining a state) needed for implementing the corresponding Simple Composition Component. 


## Decision Drivers
We want to have a list of all Enterprise Integration Patterns, that can be implemented as Simple Composition Components with a reasonable amount of effort.

## Considered Options
Theoretically, all Enterprise Integration Pattern could be implemented as Simple Composition Components

## Decision Outcome

Which of those do we want to implement??

### Routing Patterns

The following tables describes for all Routing, Transformation and Management patterns, if they can be implemented as Simple Composition Components (As defined above). 

The following assumptions are made:
- We have two Generic Components:
  - A Generic Transformation Component: Provide each message to a user-defined function and forward the result to a predefined target topic
  - A Generic Routing Component: Provides each message to a user-defined function and forward the result to the topic, that is returned by the user-defined function.
- Both components read from a single topic only
- There are no external resources available (e.g. for storing a state)
