# Monolith as Architectural Style

## Context and Problem Statement

Which architectural style should we use to build MICO?

## Considered Options

* Monolith: <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html>
* Microservice Architecture: <https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html>

## Decision Outcome

For the initial project we apply the "Monolith first" approach in order to avoid the additional complexity of a microservice architecture.
